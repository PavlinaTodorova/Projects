Hello, my name is Pavlina Todorova and today I am going to show you how to draw a smile emoji with Inkscape.

3
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:19,699
So at first when you open inkscape you will see the white page that we use for painting.

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:25,333
To create a smile emoji click on the Circle from the Tool box on the left and fill it with yellow color. 

5
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,933


6
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:33,499
For better shaping use the Control bar on the top to set the size and the coordinates of the object.

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,800
To draw an eye create an ellipse. Fill it with brown color and set the size and the coordinates. 

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:47,833


9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,366
Then again create another ellipse but place it horizontal. 

10
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:11,566
Use the Path from the Menu and click Difference to cut the eye. 

11
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:17,632
Now make Duplicate to draw the other eye and set its coordinates. 

12
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:26,799
Let’s continue with the mouth. 

13
00:01:29,266 --> 00:01:37,632
Create an ellipse. Fill it with red color and set the width and height to be perfect for a smile. 

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,133
Then create another ellipse.

15
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:52,566
Place it on the red one and make their difference to get the smile.

16
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,666
The perfect emoji has white teeth.

17
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:07,232
Click on the Pen Tool and make a straight line in the center of the smile. 

18
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:13,166
With the help of the Node Tool pull the straight line down. 

19
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:17,699
Then fill the first part of the mouth with white color.

20
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,100
Now the smile emoji is ready.
